### Workflow
We followed a structured Agile workflow:
- **Sprint Planning**: Tasks were created and prioritized in Jira, with user stories assigned to each sprint.
- **Daily Standups**: Progress was tracked daily, with updates to the Jira board reflecting the current state of the sprint.
- **Sprint Review and Retrospective**: At the end of each sprint, we reviewed completed work, discussed blockers, and planned improvements for the next sprint.

### Key Metrics
- **Sprint Velocity**: Tracked and analyzed through Jira, helping us predict future sprint capacity.
- **Burndown Charts**: Used to monitor the progress of each sprint.
