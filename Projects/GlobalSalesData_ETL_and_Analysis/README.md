**Pros of connecting Github to Jira**

  1. **Traceability**: You can easily trace commits, pull requests, and branches back to specific Jira issues, making it easier to see the development progress.
  2. **Automation**: Automatically update Jira issues based on GitHub activity, such as closing issues when a related pull request is merged.
  3. **Visibility**: Team members can get an overview of code changes without leaving Jira, which can be convenient for non-developers or stakeholders.
