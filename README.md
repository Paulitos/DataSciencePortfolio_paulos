Utilized the **Top 100 Night Clubs 2024** dataset to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Python**. This comprehensive analysis involved cleaning and processing the data, followed by detailed visualization and insights generation. Key findings include trends in club rankings, geographic distribution, and influential factors contributing to club popularity. This data-driven approach provides valuable insights for business owners to enhance their strategies and for the general public to understand the nightlife industry dynamics. The project showcases a robust methodology to derive actionable business intelligence from raw data.

**Project Summary: Credit Card Fraud Detection**

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to detect **fraudulent credit card transactions**. I used Python, leveraging libraries like **Pandas** for data preprocessing, **Scikit-learn** for model training, and **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning. A Random Forest classifier was selected and optimized, achieving a 99% precision, recall, and F1-score. This demonstrates the model's effectiveness in accurately identifying fraudulent transactions with minimal errors.
